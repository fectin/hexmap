This software is my implementation of processes described in the Traveller IP owned by Far Future Enterprises (FFE). It also uses by special permission a name generating algorithm developed by Emily at https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/
As such, it is encumbered by multiple IPs:

----

I am licensing all contributions I have made to this software (i.e., all of the implementation) under the GNU GPL License (the text of which which should be included with these files). You can do essentially anything with my contributions (but not FFE's or the planet name generator).

----

The Traveller game in all forms is owned by Far Future Enterprises. Copyright 1977 - 2008 Far Future Enterprises. As such, you will need also need FFE's permission to do anything with this software. See the included file for their full copyright notice.

Please note that I am not claiming any right to the underlying Traveller IP, just to the work I did writing this software implementation of the sector-generation processes described by Traveller. Basically, I'm fine with you using my stuff, but my stuff is inextricably intertwined with Traveller, and you need FFE's permission to use that.

Fortunately, FFE has a liberal Fair Use policy, which can be found here: https://www.farfuture.net/FFEFairUsePolicy2008.pdf

I have no connection to FFE, and I can't offer you advice on whether any use is acceptable to FFE. My understanding of their policy is that if you don't charge, you do shoot them an email at farfuture@farfuture.net, and you include the disclaimer below you can assume your non-commercial use of this software is authorized until they notify you otherwise.

----

The planet name generator I use here (planetNames.js) is based on a name generating algorithm developed by Emily at https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/ . She has graciously allowed me to re-purpose her work for this project. I extensively refactored her implementation, and I dedicate all *my* inputs to that file to the public domain or license them under Creative Commons CC-0 license. In short, you need Emily's permission to re-use that file, but you do not need mine.

Independent the above, I request (but do NOT require) that if you use this, you do the following:
 - Notify me
 - Release any derivative works in a similar spirit
